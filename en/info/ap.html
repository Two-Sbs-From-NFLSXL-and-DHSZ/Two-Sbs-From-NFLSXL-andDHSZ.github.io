        <div id = "college" >
            <h4> Recommend Score </h4>

            <p> Usually, a AP score of 4 or 5 is useful when applying for American colleges as well as exchanging course credits as students enter the college. If a score of lower than 4 is received, it is highly unrecommended to report the score to the colleges that you want to apply for. To apply for some top colleges and universities, a student should have at least 3 to 4 usable AP scores. </p>
