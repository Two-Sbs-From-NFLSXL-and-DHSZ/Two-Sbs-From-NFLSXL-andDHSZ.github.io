			<h2> A-Level </h2>
		
			<p> Advanced level is subject-based test offered by several organizations like AQA, OCR and Edexcel. As part of General Certificate of Education(GCE), A-level test is seen as a school-leaving qualification test and is required for university entrance in the United Kingdom. It takes approximately two years for students to accomplish A-level test, each year taking three to four subjects. Unlike other university-entrance tests, students are allowed to combine their favorite subjects together since A-level has no subject requirements. Besides Britain, other countries, such as Singapore, Uganda and Kenya, have also developed their own A-level systems, which only have slight difference with that in the Britain. </p>

			<h2> Advanced Placement </h2>

			<p> Advanced Placement is a program created and organized by College Board. The program offers high school students college-level courses and exams based on these courses. Students who gain high scores on AP exams would be provided with course credits and placements by US unversities and colleges. AP exams begin on the first Monday of May and last two weeks, and exams of about thirty subjects would be held during this time. AP exams are scored on a 1~5 scale, where 1 is the lowest, meaning the student is unfamiliar with the testing subject, while 5 is the highest, and the student has fully understood the content of the course. The scores of AP exams would be published in July, and students have opportunities to cancel their scores if they find them unsatisfying. </p>
