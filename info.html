			<h2> A-Level </h2>
		
			<p id = "alevel-desp" > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced level is subject-based test offered by several organizations like AQA, OCR and Edexcel. As part of General Certificate of Education(GCE), A-level test is seen as a school-leaving qualification test and is required for university entrance in the United Kingdom. It takes approximately two years for students to accomplish A-level test, each year taking three to four subjects. Unlike other university-entrance tests, students are allowed to combine their favoirte subjects together since A-level has no subject requirements. Besides Britain, other countries, such as Singapore, Uganda and Kenya, have also developed their own A-level systems, which only have slight difference with that in the Britain. </p>

The scores of AP exams would be published in July, and students have opportunities to cancel their scores if they find them unsatisfying. </p>
